# Week1-Miniproject

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
    -I am exicted to learn more html and CSS to be able to develop website.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
    - I built this site to increase my understanding of HTML and CSS
- What problem does it solve?
    - Unforturnitly this page does not solve any problems or provide any practical use outside of learning.
- What did you learn?
    - This build greatly helped my understanding of the box model within web development.
    - This helped me understand how to be able to position content on a page.
    - The power of div tags tied with classes.
    - While debugging and refactoring the code I found that part of the page had a responsive design. So I then worked to apply this to the page and minimize the breakpoints.
    - This also help me practice more git pushs and branch mergeing.
- Note 
    - The submit for this page has not action tied to it and will not capture any data.
